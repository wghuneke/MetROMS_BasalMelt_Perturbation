# MetROMS_BasalMelt_Perturbation

This is a repository with python scripts for post-processing and producing figures for:

Huneke W. G. C., Hobbs W.R., Klocker A., Naughten K. A., 2023, Dynamic response to ice shelf basal meltwater relevant to explain observed sea ice trends near the Antarctic continental shelf, Geophysical Research Letters, 50, e2023GL105435, https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL105435

The study investigates sea ice changes in West Antarctica as a response to increased basal melting in a coupled ocean/sea ice/ice shelf model on a circumpolar domain ([MetROMS](https://github.com/knaughten/metroms_iceshelf)).

Model output is available at [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/8245112), for further questions contact wilma.huneke@anu.edu.au.
