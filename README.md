# MetROMS_BasalMelt_Perturbation

This is a repository with python scripts for post-processing and producing figures for "Basal meltwater from Atnarctic ice shelves cruicial to explain observed sea ice trend" by Huneke et al. (in prep).

The study investigates sea ice changes in West Antarctica as a response to increased basal melting in a coupled ocean/sea ice/ice shelf model on a circumpolar domain ([MetROMS](https://github.com/knaughten/metroms_iceshelf)).

Post-processed data are available at [add zenodo link here] and raw model data are available upon request (wilma.huneke@anu.edu.au).
